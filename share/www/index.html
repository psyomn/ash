  <h1> Ash Home </h1>

  <p> Hello there stranger! </p>
  <p> If you were able to see this, it means that you
    have compiled and runned the ash binary successfully!</p>

  <h2> Source </h2>
  <p> Originally this started as a case study I did in university,
    where I decided to read RFC2616, and implement my own http server in
    Ada. I ended up doing so, and plan to finish off some parts I
    never got around to!</p>

  <p> Ash/(Axios former name) is available under a Apache v2 license
    (previously was under MIT, and mistakingly listed in this html file
    as GPLv3 -- I'm pretty good at this thing!), and the code
    may be accessed in the following uri: </p>

  <p> <a href="http://github.com/psyomn/ash.git">http://github.com/psyomn/ash.git</a></p>

  <p> I used to have the documentation of this case study here, but
    should still be available here:
